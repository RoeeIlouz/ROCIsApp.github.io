          <p>
            Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at ROCIs Apps. We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us.
          </p>
          <p>
            This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected through our applications (ROCIs Tasks, ROCIs Schedule, ROCIs Notes) and/or any related services, sales, marketing or events.
          </p>

          <h2>1. What Information Do We Collect?</h2>
          <h3>Personal Information You Disclose to Us</h3>
          <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on our apps or contact us.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Data:</strong> When you sign in (e.g., via Google), we may collect your name, email address, and profile picture.</li>
            <li><strong>App Data:</strong> We collect the tasks, schedules, notes, and configuration settings that you input into our apps to sync and back up your data across your devices.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
          <p>Like many apps, we also automatically collect information when you use our services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Device and Usage Data:</strong> We collect device information (such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer), operating system, version information, and system activity via analytics services.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics and Crash Data:</strong> We collect crash instances and performance metrics to help us fix bugs and improve stability.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Information from Device Capabilities</h3>
          <p>With your explicit permission, we may access certain features on your mobile device:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Calendar Access:</strong> If enabled, we request permission to read and write to your device's local calendar. We do not transmit your full calendar data to our servers; it is only used locally to create and sync events with the ROCIs apps.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. How Do We Use Your Information?</h2>
          <p>We use personal information collected via our Apps for a variety of business purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>To facilitate account creation and logon:</strong> We use your information to create and secure your account.</li>
            <li><strong>To provide our services:</strong> We use your data to synchronize items (tasks, schedules, notes) across your devices.</li>
            <li><strong>To improve our apps:</strong> Diagnostic data helps us identify crashes, manage performance, and optimize the user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>To process payments:</strong> We use third-party services like RevenueCat to handle in-app purchases and subscriptions securely. We do not directly store your payment card details.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Will Your Information Be Shared With Anyone?</h2>
          <p>We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations. Our third-party service providers include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Google LLC:</strong> Firebase Cloud Firestore, Firebase Auth, Firebase Crashlytics, and Firebase Analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> For managing in-app subscriptions and purchases.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>4. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h2>
          <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures (including secure network connections and encrypted local storage) designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. Your cloud data is encrypted in transit and at rest on Google's Firebase infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>5. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h2>
          <h3>Account Deletion</h3>
          <p>You can delete your account and all associated data at any time from within our Apps (e.g., Settings &gt; Privacy & GDPR &gt; Delete My Account & Data). This will permanently delete your authentication record and all your stored data from our servers.</p>

          <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
          <p>If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may contact us through the app or visit our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
